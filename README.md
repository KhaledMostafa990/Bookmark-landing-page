## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- sass (scss)
- Flexbox 15%
- CSS Grid 85%
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpack 5

### What I learned

- Getting more comfortable with Webpack for module bundling in order to initialize projects, despite the project isn't too big but still more efficient using Module bundlers.
- Using sass in a usable and scalable files structure approach can be used for different project sizes.
- using grid systems in many different use cases to create Advanced Complex grid layouts.
